      Here at Fake Website, we strive to experiment with making a fake website
      look as realistic and visually apealing as possible.

    <p>
      Fake Website was started by a man named meatwad787. Our great founder,
      meatwad787, was a carpenter by trade; and initially only interested in web
      development. After being rejected by a web development school, meatwad787
      took matters into his own hands.

      <br />
      He started learning some basic c# through an 8 hour tutorial but, never
      finished. 4 months passed before he would take development a little more
      seriously.
